            I work with Test Driven Development in an Agil way. I create
            webpages with React, mobile-applications with Expo/React-Native,
            APIs with Ruby on Rails. I test my front-end using Cypress and my
            back-end using RSpec

            I started building websites after a 12 week Full Stack Web Developer
            Bootcamp. 12 weeks may not sound like enough time to learn what you
            need to know to become a web developer. But I advise you who are
            reading this to check out my projects and think for yourself. "If he
            managed to learn this in 12 weeks, how much can he learn if he works
            for us??"

          <h2 className="whoTextTitle">A little about me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm working on getting my bachelor's degree in media and
            communication science. My dream is to become a FULL full-stack web
            developer sometime in the future. By that, I mean that I want to be
            able to build frontend and backend applications in combination with
            having a sufficient understanding of communicative science to know
            what type of communication to use. As well as build on my knowledge
            skills in web design to be able to make the website and the message
            of the website attractive to the user. I strongly believe that
            functionality, message and style are the cornerstones of a really
            successful website. With the help of my programming skills, I hope
            to be able to build websites with all the functionality that the
            site requires. With knowledge in the science of knowledge, I hope to
            be able to convey the website's message in a good way. In order not
            only to get visitors to the website but also to get them to stay
            there, I think you need to make it aesthetically pleasing.
