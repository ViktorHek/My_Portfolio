          I’m a music nerd graduate in social
          science, educated in basic leadership, organisation and communications
          from the gymnasium Marina Läroverket and is currently studying media
          and communication at Gothenburg University. I’m a former entrepreneur
          in The Swedish young entrepreneurship (UF) where I was the sales
          manager. Also I attended management training at STS Alpresor, I have a
          driving license, a ship commander class VIII license and I’m the team
          caption of a Swedish football team called IFK Sollentuna.

          My interests in life are sailing, music and philosophy in the likes of
          Ludwig Wittgenstein, Platon and Siddhartha Gautama. I yearn for
          knowledge in the hope of one day come as close as possible to
          understand the fundamental desires of people. The biggest interests
          currently in philosophy is happiness. What is happiness and can you
          measure it? Can you only achieve happiness if you desire it ore is it
          the other way around. Epicurus ones said “Let no one be slow to seek
          wisdom when he is young nor weary in the search of it when he has
          grown old. For no age is too early or too late for the health of the
          soul”. I intend to gain knowledge to seek wisdom.

          I have given you my merits and thinking, the only thing left is my
          process. I always strive to do things different and I have found that
          very helping in setting me apart from other people. And even when I
          fail I have at least tried something new and feel a sense of
          achievement in having fun.
